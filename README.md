## Description

_A small website containing a brief survey. The survey will ask users which methods of transportation_<br/>
_they have used to travel to work or school in the past year. The site will simply display a user's_<br/>
_responses back to them after the form has been submitted_.

## Program Specifications

 - The input:checkbox portion of this selector targets <input> fields of the type checkbox.
 - [name=work-transportation] further narrows our search.
   In addition to targeting only <input> fields of the checkbox type,
   he name attribute of the  field must also be work-transportation.
 - The :checked portion narrows it down even further. In addition to targeting only <input> fields
   of the checkbox type with a name attribute of work-transportation, we only want to retrieve
   checked check-boxes that meet these requirements.
